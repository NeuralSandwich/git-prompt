# git-prompt a native git prompt status tool

This project aims to provide a fast, informative string to be incorporated into
you're shell prompt. With this in mind `git-prompt` is written in C and uses
the `libgit2` library, enabling robust, visible, repository status discovery
without slowing down you're shell.
